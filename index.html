<p>I'm trying to learn standard opengl, but by using rust. </p>

<p>Since I couldn't find a tutorial that did what I wanted I figured I'd document my progress here. This will probably be a project journal type thing, and hopefully contain information useful to others.  It will also likely include me complaining, but hopefully in a good natured way. I've never done this before so idk how this will work out.</p>

<h1>
<a id="project-goal" class="anchor" href="#project-goal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project goal</h1>

<p>Fiddle around and make some 3d graphics, maybe eventually make a game that has graphics like starfox from the snes.
But for now I think I'd be cool with a rotating cube.
My goal is not to learn just the rustic ways of graphics, but to learn standard opengl as well.</p>

<h1>
<a id="library-choice" class="anchor" href="#library-choice" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Library choice</h1>

<p>To fit with my goal of being as close to opengl as possible I am opting to use the gl-rs <a href="https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs">https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs</a> library as opposed to gfx-rs or glium.</p>

<h1>
<a id="hardware" class="anchor" href="#hardware" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hardware</h1>

<p>I'm doing this on a dell latitude e6510 laptop I bought used and has...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OpenGL version string: 2.1 Mesa 10.3.2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yeah a bit old.</p>

<p>For an os I'm running Debian Jessie, and for whatever reason I'm using rustc nightlies although stable might be smarter.</p>

<p>Well here goes nothing.</p>

<h1>
<a id="p0" class="anchor" href="#p0" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>P0</h1>

<p>To start off I'll just make a new cargo project P0, copy my preferred rustfmt.toml over and just work on making the examples from here  <a href="https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs/tree/master/gl">https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs/tree/master/gl</a> work.</p>

<p>Getting the first example "basic.rs" running was simply a matter of adding the "gl" and "glutin" dependencies to the Cargo.toml. Moving on to "Triangle.rs" (renamed to Main.rs of course) it should be easy, just a cargo build and.... well crap.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>lets change the shader versions to 120.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>thread '' panicked at '0:2(1): error: <code>in' qualifier in declaration of</code>position' only valid for function parameters in GLSL 1.2</p>

<p>crud. But after a bit of googling and bouncing here <a href="https://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/181729-Invalid-qualifiers-in-in-global-variable">https://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/181729-Invalid-qualifiers-in-in-global-variable</a> I changed these shaders:</p>

<pre><code>// Shader sources
static VS_SRC: &amp;'static str =
   "#version 150\n\
    in vec2 position;\n\
    void main() {\n\
       gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);\n\
     }";

static FS_SRC: &amp;'static str =
   "#version 150\n\
    out vec4 out_color;\n\
    void main() {\n\
       out_color = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);\n\
    }";
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>static VS_SRC: &amp;'static str =
   "#version 120\n\
    attribute vec2 position;\n\
    void main() {\n\
       gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);\n\
    }";

static FS_SRC: &amp;'static str =
   "#version 120\n\
    void main() {\n\
        gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);\n\
    }";
</code></pre>

<p>And I get a nice white triangle. </p>

<p>This would be a good place to stop for the night, but you know it's winter in Ohio, and I'd like to think about spring; so I think I'll edit it to a nice green triangle instead.</p>

<p>Final thoughts: It's good that it is working, next time I think I/we should look into why it works. Also I'm sure I'll come back to look at this and wonder how I made so many grammar mistakes...  I should probably figure out how to add pictures.</p>

<p>Alright, I think I'll run through the example top to bottom and guess how it works. I could be totally wrong however.</p>

<h3>
<a id="license" class="anchor" href="#license" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>License</h3>

<p>First off this thing is apache licensed, presumably since I've left that alone all is fine here.</p>

<h3>
<a id="externsuses" class="anchor" href="#externsuses" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Externs/uses</h3>

<p>Pretty standard stuff here, gl and glutin both had to be in cargo.toml for this to work.</p>

<h3>
<a id="vertices-and-shaders" class="anchor" href="#vertices-and-shaders" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Vertices and shaders</h3>

<p>First off we see a simple array floats that seem to be the x,y coords for our triangle, modifying them shows this to be true.
Next:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>static VS_SRC: &amp;'static str =</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm gonna say this is a Vertex Shader, I'm not 100% positive on what it does however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);\n\</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Position seems to be the 2d coords, probably from the vertex array.
The first number is probably the Z coord.....</p>

<p>So the last coord, well I doubt we're working in a relativistic system here so to google batman!
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9943636/why-not-vec3-for-opengl-es-2-0-gl-position">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9943636/why-not-vec3-for-opengl-es-2-0-gl-position</a>
and following there to gamedev, and a link in a post by "Jovan" <a href="http://bishopw.loni.ucla.edu/air5/homogenous.html">http://bishopw.loni.ucla.edu/air5/homogenous.html</a> its for linear transformations, neat. Just for fun setting this to different (non-zero) values seems to scale the triangle; which matches what I'd expect from the link.</p>

<p>Finally:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>gl_FragColor = vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0);\n\</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is how I made the triangle green, pretty obviously rgba colors here.</p>

<h3>
<a id="compile-shader" class="anchor" href="#compile-shader" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Compile shader</h3>

<p>Well this would seem to load those shaders into opengl, nothing too crazy here.
It's neat how the shaders are basically referred to by a uint handle.</p>

<h3>
<a id="link-program" class="anchor" href="#link-program" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Link Program</h3>

<p>This seems to associate the shaders together, and returns a handle to that unit.</p>

<h3>
<a id="main" class="anchor" href="#main" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>main</h3>

<p>This seems to create the window, run the previous two fns, in fact nothing seems to interesting until we look at...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>gl::GenVertexArrays(1, &amp;mut vao);</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking here <a href="https://www.opengl.org/wiki/GLAPI/glGenVertexArrays">https://www.opengl.org/wiki/GLAPI/glGenVertexArrays</a></p>

<p>We see that the 1 means we only want to create a single vertex array, and the pointer to va0  is  a stand in for a C style int array with one element to store the new handle.</p>

<p>A similar pattern seems to hold, so I'll skip down to</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for event in window.wait_events() {</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since I'm usually in c# land the first thing I notice is an event loop rather than some callbacky-delagatey-thing here, which is cool.</p>

<p>It looks like this just colors the background black and draws the triangle, just to be sure I've changed the background to be red,  added a 4th vertex to the array in the vertices, and told it to draw another triangle using the last 3 coords like this.....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>gl::DrawArrays(gl::TRIANGLES, 1, 4);</p>
</blockquote>

<img src="images/P0/final.png" alt="Amazing graphical output! let mind = blown;" style="width:304px;height:228px;">

<p>I think this will be the final modification to P0, to see the changes I made I suppose you can diff the main.rs file with the Triangle.rs file in gl-rs if you desire.</p>

<a id="final-thoughts" class="anchor" href="#final-thoughts" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Final thoughts:</h2>

<p>Keeping this record actually is forcing me to to look a little more in depth at how this works. So thank you anonymous reader for basically serving as a rubber duck on steroids!</p>

<h2>
<a id="P1" class="anchor" href="#P1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>P1</h2>

<p>Since one of my gripes was a lack of a basic rust opengl tutorial, I think I will work through this <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming#Modern_OpenGL">https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming#Modern_OpenGL</a> one designed for c/c++ and convert the examples to rust as I go...

This adds a little more complexity to my directory structure, so P1 will be this book and TutorialXX will be each lesson from the book

 </p>
 <h2>

<a id="Tutorial 01" class="anchor" href="#Tutorial-01" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tutorial 01</h2>

<p>
  The first tutorial from the book found here <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming/Modern_OpenGL_Introduction">https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming/Modern_OpenGL_Introduction</a>

  This is quite similar to the previous triangle example, but I converted it to rust. I tried to stay as much like C as possible, so the compiler complains about some names not being rusty enough.
