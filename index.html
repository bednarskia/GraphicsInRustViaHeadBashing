<p>I'm trying to learn standard opengl, but by using rust. </p>

<p>Since I couldn't find a tutorial that did what I wanted I figured I'd document my progress here. This will probably be a project journal type thing, and hopefully contain information useful to others.  It will also likely include me complaining, but hopefully in a good natured way. I've never done this before so idk how this will work out.</p>

<a id="project-goal" class="anchor" href="#project-goal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project goal</h1>

<p>Fiddle around and make some 3d graphics, maybe eventually make a game that has graphics like starfox from the snes.
But for now I think I'd be cool with a rotating cube.
My goal is not to learn just the rustic ways of graphics, but to learn standard opengl as well.</p>

<a id="library-choice" class="anchor" href="#library-choice" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Library choice</h1>

<p>To fit with my goal of being as close to opengl as possible I am opting to use the gl-rs <a href="https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs">https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs</a> library as opposed to gfx-rs or glium.</p>

<p>I'm doing this on a dell latitude e6510 laptop I bought used and has...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OpenGL version string: 2.1 Mesa 10.3.2</p>

<p>So yeah a bit old.</p>

<p>For an os I'm running Debian Jessie, and for whatever reason I'm using rustc nightlies although stable might be smarter.</p>

<p>Well here goes nothing.</p>

<p>To start off I'll just make a new cargo project P0, copy my preferred rustfmt.toml over and just work on making the examples from here  <a href="https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs/tree/master/gl">https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs/tree/master/gl</a> work.</p>
