<p>I'm trying to learn standard opengl, but by using rust. </p>

<p>Since I couldn't find a tutorial that did what I wanted I figured I'd document my progress here. This will probably be a project journal type thing, and hopefully contain information useful to others.  It will also likely include me complaining, but hopefully in a good natured way. I've never done this before so idk how this will work out.</p>

<a id="project-goal" class="anchor" href="#project-goal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project goal</h1>

<p>Fiddle around and make some 3d graphics, maybe eventually make a game that has graphics like starfox from the snes.
But for now I think I'd be cool with a rotating cube.
My goal is not to learn just the rustic ways of graphics, but to learn standard opengl as well.</p>

<a id="library-choice" class="anchor" href="#library-choice" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Library choice</h1>

<p>To fit with my goal of being as close to opengl as possible I am opting to use the gl-rs <a href="https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs">https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs</a> library as opposed to gfx-rs or glium.</p>

<p>I'm doing this on a dell latitude e6510 laptop I bought used and has...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>OpenGL version string: 2.1 Mesa 10.3.2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yeah a bit old.</p>

<p>For an os I'm running Debian Jessie, and for whatever reason I'm using rustc nightlies although stable might be smarter.</p>

<p>Well here goes nothing.</p>

<h1>
<a id="p0" class="anchor" href="#p0" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>P0</h1>

<p>To start off I'll just make a new cargo project P0, copy my preferred rustfmt.toml over and just work on making the examples from here  <a href="https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs/tree/master/gl">https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs/tree/master/gl</a> work.</p>

<p>Getting the first example "basic.rs" running was simply a matter of adding the "gl" and "glutin" dependencies to the Cargo.toml. Moving on to "Triangle.rs" (renamed to Main.rs of course) it should be easy, just a cargo build and.... well crap.</p>

<p>lets change the shader versions to 120.</p>

<p>crud. But after a bit of googling and bouncing here <a href="https://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/181729-Invalid-qualifiers-in-in-global-variable">https://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/181729-Invalid-qualifiers-in-in-global-variable</a> I changed these shaders:</p>

<pre><code>// Shader sources
static VS_SRC: &amp;'static str =
   "#version 150\n\
    in vec2 position;\n\
    void main() {\n\
       gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);\n\
     }";

static FS_SRC: &amp;'static str =
   "#version 150\n\
    out vec4 out_color;\n\
    void main() {\n\
       out_color = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);\n\
    }";
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>static VS_SRC: &amp;'static str =
   "#version 120\n\
    attribute vec2 position;\n\
    void main() {\n\
       gl_Position = vec4(position, 0.0, 1.0);\n\
    }";

static FS_SRC: &amp;'static str =
   "#version 120\n\
    void main() {\n\
        gl_FragColor = vec4(1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0);\n\
    }";
</code></pre>

<p>And I get a nice white triangle. </p>

<p>This would be a good place to stop for the night, but you know it's winter in Ohio, and I'd like to think about spring; so I think I'll edit it to a nice green triangle instead.</p>

<p>Final thoughts: It's good that it is working, next time I think I/we should look into why it works. Also I'm sure I'll come back to look at this and wonder how I made so many grammar mistakes...  I should probably figure out how to add pictures.</p>
