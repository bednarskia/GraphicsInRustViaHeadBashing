This will probably be a project journal type thing, and hopefully contain information useful to others.  It will also likely include me complaining, but hopefully in a good natured way. I've never done this before so idk how this will work out.\r\n\r\n#Project goal\r\n\r\nFiddle around and make some 3d graphics, maybe eventually make a game that has graphics like starfox from the snes.\r\nBut for now I think I'd be cool with a rotating cube.\r\nMy goal is not to learn just the rustic ways of graphics, but to learn standard opengl as well.\r\n\r\n#Library choice\r\nTo fit with my goal of being as close to opengl as possible I am opting to use the gl-rs https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs library as opposed to gfx-rs or glium.\r\n\r\n#hardware\r\n\r\nI'm doing this on a dell latitude e6510 laptop I bought used and has...\r\n>OpenGL version string: 2.1 Mesa 10.3.2\r\n\r\nSo yeah a bit old.\r\n\r\nFor an os I'm running Debian Jessie, and for whatever reason I'm using rustc nightlies although stable might be smarter.\r\n\r\nWell here goes nothing.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n#P0\r\nTo start off I'll just make a new cargo project P0, copy my preferred rustfmt.toml over and just work on making the examples from here  https://github.com/bjz/gl-rs/tree/master/gl work.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
